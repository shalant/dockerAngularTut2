# Introduction
This is a project to learn docker-compose, a tool to run multiple containers at once. This application has a front-end Task App built with Angular, and a mock back-end NPM package.

# How to Use
From the terminal, type 'git clone https://github.com/shalant/dockerAngularTut2.git'. From the command line, simply run 'docker-compose up', and two containers will build and run. In the browser, go to the URL: http://localhost:4200/ to see the Task App.

# Who built these?
I did not! The front- and back-end is code from Traversy on Youtube, and the Docker part is by Moon Data
